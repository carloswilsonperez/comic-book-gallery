This is a basic project using ASP.NET MVC 5. This is the project I built following along with the Treehouse ASP.NET MVC Basics Course taught by James Churchill. I am grateful to Treehouse for producing high quality training and making it available at affordable prices. 

This project allows me to really understand what is going on. I both enjoying building this project and learning a great deal.  I have a good foundation to build more complex applications and troubleshoot and maintain existing applications.

This is a basic project using ASP.NET MVC 5. This is the project I built following along with the Treehouse ASP.NET MVC Basics Course taught by James Churchill. I am grateful to Treehouse for producing high quality training and making it available at affordable prices. 

The simplicity of the project allowed me to learn the basics of ASP.NET MVC 5 and understand what is really going on. I both enjoyed this course and learned a great deal so I'm in good shape to build more complex applications and troubleshoot and maintain existing applications.
